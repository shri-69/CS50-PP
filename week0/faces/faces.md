# Faces 😃😞

This project demonstrates a simple Python program that converts textual emoticons into emojis.

## 📝 Description

Before emojis, people used **emoticons** like `:)` and `:(` to express feelings in text. This program replaces:

- `:)` with 🙂 (slightly smiling face)
- `:(` with 🙁 (slightly frowning face)

All other text remains unchanged.

## 🚀 How It Works

- The `convert()` function takes a string and replaces all emoticons with corresponding emojis.
- The `main()` function gets user input, calls `convert()`, and prints the result.

## 🧪 Example

**Input:**
I'm happy :) but sometimes sad :(


**Output:**
I'm happy 🙂 but sometimes sad 🙁


## 🛠️ How to Run

Make sure you have Python installed. Then, run the script using:

```bash
python faces.py
