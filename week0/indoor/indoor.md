# 🏠 indoor.py - Lowercase Text Converter

## 📘 Description

The `indoor.py` program is a simple Python script that takes user input and converts all letters in the text to lowercase. This small but practical program simulates a common scenario: replacing "yelling" (ALL CAPS) with a more polite "indoor voice" (lowercase text).

The concept reinforces the importance of proper tone and formatting in digital communication. It’s particularly helpful in learning how to manipulate strings in Python using built-in methods.

## 🧠 Problem Motivation

In online communication, using ALL CAPS is often interpreted as shouting or yelling. To encourage polite and respectful digital interaction, it's useful to "tone down" text by converting it to lowercase. This program automates that process.

The core functionality involves:
- Accepting a string of input from the user
- Converting every uppercase letter to its lowercase equivalent
- Printing the resulting text

This operation preserves:
- Whitespace
- Punctuation
- Symbols
- Numbers

Only uppercase alphabetic characters are changed.

## ✅ Features

- Converts **all uppercase letters** to lowercase
- Preserves **punctuation**, **numbers**, and **spacing**
- Uses Python’s `.lower()` method
- Friendly prompt for user input

---

## 🖥️ Example

Please enter your text: HELLO WORLD!!!
hello world!!!

## 📂 File Structure

- `indoor.py` – Main script that contains:
  - A single input prompt
  - A call to `.lower()` to convert the string
  - A print statement for the lowercase output

---

## ▶️ How to Run

Make sure Python is installed, then run:

```bash
python indoor.py
