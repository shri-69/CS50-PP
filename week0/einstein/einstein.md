# Einstein's Energy-Mass Equivalence Calculator

This Python program implements **Einstein’s famous equation**:
E = mc²


Where:
- `E` = Energy in Joules  
- `m` = Mass in kilograms (user input)  
- `c` = Speed of light in meters per second (`300,000,000 m/s`)

## 📄 File

- `einstein.py`

## 🚀 How It Works

The program prompts the user to enter a mass in kilograms. It then calculates the equivalent energy using the formula `E = m * c²`, and prints the result as an integer.

## 💻 Example

```bash
$ python einstein.py
Enter mass in kilograms: 1
90000000000000000

This means 1 kg of mass is equivalent to 90,000,000,000,000,000 Joules.
